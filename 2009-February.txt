with openmeeting-irc?.

?Hi,

Commercial support is planned but is not available still,

?Hello,

I hope you might a minute to answer a couple of questions.

I saw your post on the OpenMeetings forum.

I am trying to figure out if your newest Cooperation-iws Live CD server 
would be good for me and my project.

I've had a good look at your website and I'm a little confused.

I'm a bit of a newb and don't have too much experience setting up 
servers and such.

I'm currently looking for a live- CD system that will allow me to set up 
a web server and run OpenMeetings.

Will your system do this?

Who is your system aimed at?

Could you take a minute to explain what a person might use your system for?

Thanks in advance for any information.

Best


Joe

?Hello Joe,

A cooperation-iws server is "ready made " server contained on a live CD. 
You just need to boot the iso cd to have a fully functionnal server.

If you want to keep changes made during the session you need to install 
the Live CD to USB media with the installer that is on the desktop of 
the Live CD.

To have a fully functional openmeetings server either you download the 
eLearning Standalone edition which is a package with eLearning Portal 
and mail server,

or you download the communication server from the intranet suite which 
contains only open meetings with an IRC server. You might download as 
well the administration server of the intranet suite if you want to 
monitor the open meetings server.

So to answer your question, I think Cooperation-iws fits your needs.

My system is aimed at different audience: personal intranet, association 
intranet, school intranet, or small company intranet.

My system is dedicated to people that want to use online tools but 
without administration, security and privacy concerns, as the system fit 
on usb key, is live technology with less administration and is not 
necessary connected to the Internet.

I hope I have answered to your question, if not feel free to contact me 
again,

Regards,
Oliv

?Olivier,

Thanks for your reply.

I'm interested in using your program as a web-server so that I am able 
to conduct OpenMeetings over the web.

Is this possible or is using it over an intranet the only option?

Also, I'm not entirely sure by what you mean by 'intranet'?

Does this mean that your Live-CD / USB is designed to run on large 
networked intranets in say a company or a university?

Thanks for any advice.

Also, just to let you know, I'm having terrible trouble downloading the 
program.

I have an extremely fast connection here in Taiwan but for some strange 
reason the download keeps timing out at some point and I'm left with 
only a fraction of the file.

I'm now using a 'download' manager to try and resume it if it times out 
again.

Please let me know if you move your programs to source-forge or another 
similar site.

Thanks again,

?Hello Joe,

Let's say that I mean Intranet by private Internet. So intranet is any 
LAN you could find. But basically the technology is the same as Internet.

As a Cooperation-iws server has much open ports than a normal web 
server, I advise you not to connect the Cooperation-iws server directly 
to Internet but rather to make a port forwarding from a gateway (For 
Openmeetings the port are those of the Red server).

For the download problems, I am sorry, but the actual hosting provider 
is based in France and this is the only one who accept hosting so large 
number of big files (Source forge doesn't accept) for free.

If you know free hosting provider in Taiwan that accept to host 12GB of 
files, let me know and I would upload the files.

Thanks for your interest in Cooperation-iws

Regards,

Oliv

?Hi,

With Community Live DVD it is not possible as they are already build. 
But if if you want to do that you can install onto USB (Cheap Usb key of 
4gb cost 9 ?) with persistent feature for server (see 
http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/CMS/?page_id=44) and then add the 
following line in /var/share/etc/rc.ciws:

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |firefox http://localhost/Your_Joomla_Path|



This line will make firefox pop up at the beginning of the session at 
the url http://localhost/Your_Joomla_Path.

If you don't find http://localhost/Your_Joomla_Path, just let 
http://localhost and this will open window in Cooperation-iws portal 
where you will have access to all applications.

The advantage of Live USB with persistent feature is that it works like 
normal server and save all changes in your Joomla application.


You must be sure to understand that Cooperation-iws wont work on Windows 
but is rather a full Operating system that boot instead of Windows on 
the Usb key.


Regards,

Olivier

?Okay, I did everything in your instructions. I was able to make the USB 
boot drive. I booted up the USB drive and the operating system came up 
fine. However, when I go edit the file, /var/share/etc/rc.ciws , it 
won't let me save it. It seems that I can not make any changes to any of 
the system files.

Anything in the system folder I can not change. I can access and change 
things on the USB drive, but not any of the system files. How is that 
possible? Aren't the system files coming from the USB drive? It's very 
strange.

?hi,

While making your Usb key you should have selected persistent mode with 
ciws-rw partition for server. Then all the /var directory should be 
writeable if you have the right permissions.

To modify rc.ciws, you should be in super user mode using the sudo command:

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |sudo nano /var/share/etc/rc.ciws|



default password for sudo is : cooperation

Regards,

Olivier

?Thank you so much for the quick responses.

Okay, I did everything you suggested. Right now my rc.ciws file is as 
follows:

firefox http://localhost
rm /etc/rc0.d/*casper*
rm /etc/rc6.d/*casper*

However, when I reboot and the USB drive starts the operating system, 
nothing pops up. It just boots up as it normally would. And I get the 
following error:

The program xfcc4-places-plugin closed unexpectedly

Now, maybe that has nothing to do with firefox opening. But firefox 
still doesn't open and nothing happens.

Also, I have a question about permissions. Is there anyway I can change 
the permissions (maybe login as root), so I can just copy files through 
the file manager? Using sudo in the command line to do everything is 
very time consuming. I understand the risk being logged in as root, but 
I'm willing to take the risk. I would rather just be able to do 
everything through file manager. 8-)

?Hi,

to start Files manager as root:

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |sudo thunar|



to start graphical editor as root:

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |sudo mousepad|



I am sorry for last solution, as I have tested it and it doesn't work 
because you can't launch graphical applications from rc.local

I have also test to add firefox to autostart in rc.ciws but this does 
not work either as rc.ciws is called too late after the session startup.

So the last solution you have is to remaster the Live CD and add the 
following file ciws.desktop in /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ (create 
directories if they do not exist)

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |[Desktop Entry]
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Version=0.9.4
    Type=Application
    Name=Cooperation-iws
    Comment=
    Exec=firefox http://localhost
    StartupNotify=false
    Terminal=false
    Hidden=false|



and do not forget to make the following command after:

Code: Select all 
<http://www.cooperation-iws.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=9&sid=5f52a3a979a34f8d7ab9e547cd6997de#>
    |sudo  chmod -R 755 /etc/skel/.config/|



This will be fixed in 0.9 release as /home directory will also be 
persistent.

Olivier

?

    So the last solution you have is to remaster the Live CD and add the
    following file ciws.desktop in /etc/skel/.config/autostart/ (create
    directories if they do not exist)



Do you have any resource or instructions on how I can do this?
